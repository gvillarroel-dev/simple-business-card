## Summary

![screenshot](./assets/resources/thumbnail.jpg)

I created a decent-looking business card instead of just winging it in five minutes. I had to get the design right, which involved figuring out how to overlay images and text correctly.

Honestly, the hardest part was getting comfortable with absolute positioning. I used to avoid it completely because it seemed to ruin everything, but this project forced me to really understand what's going on.

### What I learned

- **Absolute positioning isn't bad**: Turns out it's just misunderstood. Once you get familiar with relative containers and absolute children, it's quite useful for overlays and precise positioning.

- **Image and Text Overlay**: Getting background images to blend well with overlay text while maintaining readability. Z-index is no longer a mystery.

- **Why do things appear where they appear?**: The stacking order finally worked after dealing with elements appearing in strange places.

### Helpful Resources

- [MDN CSS Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - Explains positioning without making you feel stupid.
- [Z-Index CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/z/z-index/) - Helped me stop guessing about overlap.

## Build with

- HTML5 Markup
- CSS Positioning and Overlays
- Image Overlay Techniques
- Basic Typographic Styling

## Features

- **Fits Design Exactly**: Created to specifications with correct spacing, fonts, and layout, matching the provided mockup.

- **Properly Layered Images**: Background and overlay images stack correctly without any strange visual glitches or positioning issues.

- **Readable Text Hierarchy**: The title stands out, the description is clear, and author information fits naturally without competing for attention.

- **Clean Component Code**: The HTML structure makes sense, and the CSS is organized enough to be reused elsewhere.

- **Stable Positioning**: Elements stay in place, even when the browser window is resized.
